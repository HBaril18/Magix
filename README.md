The aim of this project is to develop a web-based collectible card game, inspired by popular titles like Hearthstone, but entirely built using HTML and CSS. 
The goal is to create a lightweight, responsive game that runs smoothly in modern web browsers. This game was made during a course with the help of the teacher for the beggining.
